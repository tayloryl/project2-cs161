# project2
In this project, you will apply the cryptographic primitives introduced in class to design and implement the client application for a secure file sharing system. Imagine something similar to Dropbox, but secured with cryptography so that the server cannot view or tamper with your data.

The client will be written in Golang and will allow users to take the following actions:

Authenticate with a username and password;

Save files to the server;

Load saved files from the server;

Overwrite saved files on the server;

Append to saved files on the server;

Share saved files with other users; and

Revoke access to previously shared files.
